          >. Menarche is preceded by puberty-induced body changes that occur
          between ages 9 and 16 years. The age at which menarche occurs is
          affected by genetic and environmental factors. Menarche may be delayed
          by poor nutrition, high levels of exercise (athletes or dancers), and
          several medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, congenital
          heart disease, and ulcerative colitis. Early menarche may occur with
          other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, CNS tumors, and head trauma.
          Girls usually show an increase in height of only 2 to 3 inches after
          the onset of menstruation.<br /><br />

            >Effect of Menarche on Height, Weight, and BMI; Relation With
            Obesity</b
          ><br /><br />
          Menarche is attained earlier by well-nourished adolescents. The
          adolescents look clumsy at the first phase of their development as the
          growth pattern is uneven including the lengthening of the calves and
          forearm followed by the hips, chest, and shoulder. Presently, menarche
          is preceded in girls about 8–9 years , boys attains height surge after
          13 while a typical girl attains 95% of her adult height at about 1
          year before menarche and the rest after attaining adolescence.<br /><br>
          After the main growth spurt starts, it continues for 2–4 years at a
          much slower rate in boys whereas girls growth outperforms. The
          beginning of the increase in growth velocity is about age 11 in boys
          and 9 in girls; but varies widely from individual to individual. Long
          bones epiphysial closure is a remarkable end point of adolescent
          growth. If the epiphysial closure is earlier as a consequence of
          malnutrition, the full potential height fails to be achieved. On
          average, smaller parents are having smaller children than children of
          taller parents; bone age is fairly accurate with chronologic age,
          those children usually show an appropriate rate of growth during early
          years of life and childhood days and accomplish sexual maturation and
          pubertal growth spurt at the usual ages.<br /><br>
          The growth rate in menarche is associated with both the age and the
          height during the year prior to the menarche. Postmenarche girls were
          having a high BMI with significantly higher height and weight than the
          premenarche counterparts. Growth rate changes before and after
          menarche supported that the relationship between height and age is
          statistically significant (0.05 and 0.01 level of significance),
          demarcating their entrance into adolescence. The magnitude of the
          growth slope changes before and after menarche is almost 0.3 cm per
          year. In some previous studies menarche age was positively associated
          with height and negatively associated with weight and BMI. The various
          factors affecting the age at menarche directly and indirectly are
          geographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors.
